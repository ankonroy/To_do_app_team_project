## 1. Title and Abstract

### Title
**Development of a Web-Based Todo Application with Secure User Authentication and Task Management**

### Abstract
This project presents the design and implementation of a web-based Todo application that helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application was built using modern web technologies including NestJS for the backend, MongoDB for database management, and EJS for rendering dynamic views. The system includes secure user authentication, complete task management features (create, read, update, delete), and session management. This report covers the entire development process following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from initial planning to deployment and testing.

**Keywords:** Todo Application, Task Management, NestJS, MongoDB, User Authentication, CRUD Operations, Web Development

## 2. Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, people need simple and effective tools to organize their daily activities. A todo application serves as a personal assistant that helps users keep track of their tasks, set priorities, and complete their work on time. 

Our project aims to develop a user-friendly web application where users can:
- Create an account and log in securely
- Add new tasks with titles and descriptions
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks they no longer need
- View all their tasks in one place

The application is built with security in mind, ensuring that each user's data is protected and only accessible to them. We used industry-standard technologies and followed best practices throughout the development process.

### Background
Traditional paper-based todo lists have limitations - they can be lost, damaged, or forgotten. Digital todo applications solve these problems by providing a reliable, accessible platform that users can access anytime. However, many existing solutions are either too complicated or lack essential features. Our application aims to find the right balance between simplicity and functionality.

### Problem Statement
Many people struggle to keep track of their tasks and often forget important activities. Existing todo applications either:
- Require payment for basic features
- Have complicated interfaces that confuse users
- Don't provide proper security for user data
- Lack essential features like task editing and user authentication

Our solution addresses these issues by providing a free, simple, and secure todo application with all necessary features.

## 3. Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Develop a functional web-based todo application** that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently
2. **Implement secure user authentication** to protect user accounts and data
3. **Create a user-friendly interface** that anyone can use without technical knowledge
4. **Ensure data persistence** so users don't lose their tasks when they close the application

### Secondary Objectives
1. Design and implement a proper database schema for storing user and task information
2. Follow software engineering best practices and SDLC phases systematically
3. Implement session management for maintaining user login states
4. Create comprehensive documentation including diagrams and test reports
5. Deploy the application so it can be accessed by real users

### Learning Objectives
Through this project, our team aimed to:

## 4. Literature Review

### Existing Solutions
We studied several existing todo applications to understand common features and identify areas for improvement:

**Todoist:** A popular task management application with features like project organization, labels, and reminders. However, it requires a premium subscription for many features.

**Microsoft To Do:** A simple application with good integration with Microsoft services. Limited customization options for users.

**Google Tasks:** Very basic functionality integrated with Gmail. Lacks features like task descriptions and user management.

### Technology Research
**Backend Frameworks:** We evaluated Express.js, NestJS, and FastAPI. We chose NestJS because:
- It provides a structured, modular architecture
- Built-in support for TypeScript
- Excellent documentation and community support
- Easy integration with databases and authentication

**Databases:** We compared SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases:
- Chose MongoDB because our data structure is document-based
- Flexible schema allows easy modifications
- Good performance for read-heavy applications
- Easy to set up and use

**Authentication Methods:** Researched JWT tokens, OAuth, and session-based authentication:
- Selected session-based authentication for simplicity
- Used bcrypt for password hashing
- Implemented secure session storage in MongoDB

## 7. System Design

### 7.1 System Architecture

Our application follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture pattern:

**Model:** Represents the data structure
- `User` schema: Stores user information (email, password, creation date)
- `Todo` schema: Stores task information (title, description, completion status, owner)
- `Session` schema: Stores user session data

**View:** User interface layer
- EJS templates for rendering HTML pages
- Forms for user input
- Dynamic content display based on user data

**Controller:** Business logic layer
- `AuthController`: Handles registration, login, logout
- `TodosController`: Manages task operations
- `UserController`: Manages user profile

**Service:** Data access layer
- `AuthService`: Authentication business logic
- `TodosService`: Task management business logic
- `UserService`: User management business logic

### 7.2 Database Design

We used MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for data storage. Our database has three main collections:

**Users Collection:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  email: String (unique),
  password: String (hashed),
  createdAt: Date
}
```

**Todos Collection:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  description: String,
  completed: Boolean,
  userId: ObjectId (reference to Users),
  createdAt: Date
}
```

**Sessions Collection:**
```javascript
{
  _id: String,
  expires: Date,
  session: {
    user: Object,
    cookie: Object
  }
}
```

**Relationships:**
- One User can have many Todos (1:N relationship)
- One User can have many Sessions (1:N relationship)

### 7.3 API Design

**Authentication Endpoints:**
- `GET /auth/register` - Display registration form
- `POST /auth/register` - Create new user account
- `GET /auth/login` - Display login form
- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate user
- `POST /auth/logout` - End user session

**Todo Endpoints:**
- `GET /todos` - Display all user's tasks
- `POST /todos` - Create new task
- `GET /todos/:id` - View single task
- `PUT /todos/:id` - Update task
- `DELETE /todos/:id` - Delete task

**User Endpoints:**
- `GET /users/profile` - View user profile
- `PUT /users/profile` - Update profile information

### 7.4 Security Design

**Password Security:**
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds
- Plain text passwords never stored
- Password strength validation on registration

**Session Security:**
- Secure session cookies with HTTP-only flag
- Session expiration after 24 hours
- Session data stored in MongoDB

**Authorization:**
- Session guards protect authenticated routes
- Users can only access their own data
- Proper error messages without revealing system details
